//! The split estimator: soft coordinates non-parametrically, hard ones with a
//! Gaussian.
//!
//! Multi-basin torsions are poorly described by a Gaussian, while bonds,
//! angles and phase angles are close to harmonic, and a Gaussian captures
//! their correlations to every order. The split estimator divides the
//! coordinates into a soft set S and a hard set H and writes
//!
//! S = S_soft + S_hard + coupling,
//!
//! - S_soft: the nearest-neighbor MIE, the mutual information spanning tree
//!   (MIST) or a joint nearest-neighbor estimate over the soft coordinates;
//! - S_hard: the quasi-harmonic (QH) or Boltzmann quasi-harmonic (BQH)
//!   entropy of the hard coordinates over all frames;
//! - the coupling term, at most 0, for the dependence between the two sets:
//!   either the Gaussian mutual information between them, or the change in
//!   the hard entropy when it is computed within each conformational state of
//!   the soft torsions and averaged over the states.
//!
//! The soft set is given explicitly, or detected from the data with
//! [`detect_basins`]. For coordinates read from a topology,
//! [`InternalCoordinates::soft_torsions`](crate::bat_library::InternalCoordinates::soft_torsions)
//! gives the topological default: the primary torsion about each rotatable
//! bond.
